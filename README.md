## Trail Tales: Include a description of your app and what it does. Background info about the game and why you chose it is a nice touch.

I created Trail Tales because of my hobby of biking! I have been biking more and learning more about gear,common practices, trails, my community, and fitness goals. I wanted a way to document my bike rides by statistical information to track my progress and in a blog setting so I could utilize the pictures I took and share stories from my rides on the trails.

## **Getting started**: Include a link to your deployed app and any instructions you deem important. This should also contain a link to your planning materials.

Future Goals:
- blogs: They will have a many to many relationship with the rides. This will also be used to grow the community aspect of the app. Eventually I want people to positively interact and engae with each other.
- - I want users to have the option to share their entries publicly or keep them private.
- Ride Stats: setting/ visualizing goals for fitness.
- Goals & bages: Engagement.
